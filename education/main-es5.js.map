some contexts, an educator) is a person who helps students\r\n            to acquire knowledge, competence or virtue.\r\n\r\n            Informally the role of teacher may be taken on by anyone (e.g. when showing a colleague how to perform a\r\n            specific task). In some countries, teaching young people of school age may be carried out in an informal\r\n            setting, such as within the family (homeschooling), rather than in a formal setting such as a school or\r\n            college. Some other professions may involve a significant amount of teaching (e.g. youth worker, pastor).\r\n\r\n            In most countries, formal teaching of students is usually carried out by paid professional teachers. This\r\n            article focuses on those who are employed, as their main role, to teach others in a formal education\r\n            context, such as at a school or other place of initial formal education or training.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  <div class=\"col-12 w-100 mt-3\" style=\"height: 600px;\">\r\n    <app-schedule-seven-days></app-schedule-seven-days>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n","/* (ignored) */","import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';\r\n\r\nimport { ReportsRoutingModule } from './reports-routing.module';\r\nimport { ReportsAttendanceComponent } from './reports-attendance/reports-attendance.component';\r\nimport { ReportsComponent } from './reports.component';\r\nimport { FontAwesomeModule } from '@fortawesome/angular-fontawesome';\r\nimport { ReportsLearningComponent } from './reports-learning/reports-learning.component';\r\nimport { ReportsQuizComponent } from './reports-quiz/reports-quiz.component';\r\nimport { ReportsPracticeComponent } from './reports-practice/reports-practice.component';\r\nimport { ReportsAssignmentComponent } from './reports-assignment/reports-assignment.component';\r\nimport { ChartsModule } from 'ng2-charts';\r\nimport { ScoreReportComponent } from './score-report/score-report.component';\r\nimport { AbilityAnalysisComponent } from './ability-analysis/ability-analysis.component';\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [\r\n    ReportsComponent,\r\n    ReportsAttendanceComponent,\r\n    ReportsLearningComponent,\r\n    ReportsQuizComponent,\r\n    ReportsPracticeComponent,\r\n    ReportsAssignmentComponent,\r\n    ScoreReportComponent,\r\n    AbilityAnalysisComponent\r\n  ],\r\n  imports: [\r\n    CommonModule,\r\n    ReportsRoutingModule,\r\n    FontAwesomeModule,\r\n    ChartsModule\r\n  ]\r\n})\r\nexport class ReportsModule { }\r\n","import { AbstractControl } from '@angular/forms';\r\n\r\nexport function TrimRequiredValidatorr(control: AbstractControl): { [key: string]: any } | null {\r\n  // console.log('TrimRequiredValidatorr control value', control.value);\r\n  const value = control.value;\r\n  if (! value) { return { appTrimRequiredValidator: { valid: false }}; }\r\n  const trimText = String(value) ?
